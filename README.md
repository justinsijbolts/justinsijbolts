# ðŸ’«About Me :

Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Justin Sijbolts, CEO at PartydoosMedia.

I am currently studying Software and Game Development at Alfa College (Groningen, the Netherlands).

My passion for programming began at a young age, and I have been honing my skills ever since. I have a strong background in problem-solving, creativity, and communication, which I put to use in creating interesting and exciting experiences for people. Additionally, my ability to deal with stress and work efficiently allows me to thrive in fast-paced environments.
